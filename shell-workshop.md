# Course Notes: 

Lesson 1.1 The Command Line:
Why does command line matter? 
* GUI alternative
* GUI is easy to use but isn't as flexible as command line.
* Command Line involves typing.
* Some tasks are nearly impossible to do with GUI, as GUI isn't easily programmable.
* An example of command line interface is Linux Shell.
* you can write scrits to automate tasks
* With Command Line, you can build larger programs from smaller ones. 

NOTE: While not included in the course materials, I knew command line before GUI ever existed.  All computers were in machine code, compiler languages, or basic before there ever was any type of GUI interface.  GUI isn't how computers operate--they have to be instructed to be "GUI" so to speak. 

Lesson 1.2  Intro to Shell
* The Shell is a Command Line interface for running programs on your computer. 
* Developers use it a lot. 
* Most web servers run on Linux and need command line. 
* The program we uwe to interact with the shell is called a terminal. 
* Both Mac or Linux, you have already got a good terminal program. 
* If you are on Windows, you will need to install a shell and a terminal program which works the same as on Mac or Linux. 
* Windows does have a built-in command line, which (as I mentioned after completing the lesson above, is based on the old MS DOS)
* Because most of the web runs on Linux servers, Linux shell/terminal is pretty much the professional standard. 
* This course uses the BASH SHELL (which is by far the most popular Unix style shell.



Lesson 1.3 Windows ONLY: 
Download Git here: https://git-scm.com/download/win
Windows10 now includes a Windows Subsystem for Linux or WSL.
It is experimental and therefore isn't used in this course. 

Lesson 1.4: Openning a Terminal
* The Terminal is just an interface to the Shell. 
* Pretty much every Terminal program has a bunch of settings you can play around with to change the fonts, colors, etc. 
* You can have any number of terminals open at once. 
* Each new terminal which you open is a seperate instance of the shell. 
* Look things up online. 
* There is so much information on line, developers need to get in the habit of looking things up online. 

Lesson 1:4: Your first command (echo)
