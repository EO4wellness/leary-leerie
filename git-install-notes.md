# Introduction
This outlines the current installation of GIT, needed to follow along in the Version Control course, as well as future use. 

# Default Text Editor:
Upon install, you can select a variety of options for Git to use as its default text editor.  If none are selected, it will use the OS default. You may (or may not) want to install the text editor you want to use with Git, if you don't want to use the default, and/or don't already have one of the other options installed.  The options do not show up upong GIT installation, if they are not already installed on your device prior to installing GIT. 
Options include:

# Config
The Version Control Course goes through the various config options as a part of the coursework as a work-along with the content flow.  However, there are various options available. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration

# Testing 
After installing or doing any new step, be it as simple as an HTML link, markdown link, or something more complex, I believe in TESTING everything--even when you think it is perfect.  Cut-n-paste errors happen!  Along the lines of testing, after installation, this course makes a lovely joke! The course, after instructing to install Git using the default settings, simply states "You should now be able to run GIT from the command line."  The course assumes someone knows how to use command line. 

        c:\>git
        
        usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
