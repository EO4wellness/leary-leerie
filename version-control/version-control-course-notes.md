# Course Notes 

VCS (Version Control System)
A VCS helps you to keep a detailed history of a project.  
A VCS also helps you work on different ideas or versions of the same project. 
Also known as: Revision Control, Source Control, or Source Code Management 


Many different types of VSC out there.  
Some examples are:
* Git 
* Subversion
* Mercurial

Type of VCS:
* Centralized Model – One all-powerful, centralized computer.  Every transaction has to go thru that computer. 
* Distributed Model -  One advantage is, you can work off line, as there isn’t one centeral computer everything goes thru.  Git is a distributed model so you can work off line. 

Git VS GitHub 
People are often confused by the similarly named Git and GitHub, but they are two entirely different things.  
Git is a version control tool where as GitHub is used to host Git projects. 

The most simplest form of version control is the keyboard commands and/or function to “undo” or “redo” in word processing software.  Likewise, it is similar in professional editing software such as preimere pro or photoshop where you can restore a historical point in the file you are working on.  Many software types, have a revision history feature built in.  Google Dogs, for example, or Word Press.
