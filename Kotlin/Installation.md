    2. If you do not have it, or do not have the latest version, download and install JDK.
    3. Install IntelliJ. This course uses IntelliJ and we recommend you use the same IDE.
    4. Start IntelliJ.
    5. Install any updates and additional content you are prompted for.
    6. Select IntelliJ IDEA -> Check for updatesâ€¦ until there are no more updates.



# Steps to Set up a Project: 
JDK (java developoment kit) 

1.  If you don't already ahve a JDK insalled, first install a JDK. 
2.  When you first start IntelliJ for the very first time, you have to set it up--> follow the on screen prompts. 
3.  Next, on the Welcome Screen select to create a new Kotlin Project.  To do so, click to add a new project. 
4.  Wait for the screen to change. 
5.  Select: Kotlin in the left-hand menu (Kotlin JVM) 
6.  Name your project (for this course we're naming the first one "HelloKotlin" 
7.  Click Finish 

The above steps have created our first project which is set up to run Kotlin. 

### REPL: 
* Now that you are in a project, you have access to the Kotlin REPL. 
* Kotlin REPL: Read-Eval-Print loop 
* a REPL evaluates the code you are typing right after you hit the enter comand.  
* a REPL is not a compliler; it doesn't run the code 
* Locate it from IntellJ IDEA --> Tools --> Kotlin --> Kotlin REPL 
* type or paste our code (block below) into the REPL 
```
```
* Type Control + Enter to execute the code 
* Wait
* You should see "Hello World" (in green, in the default setup theme)
