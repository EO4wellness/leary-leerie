# Functions 
* Create and call functions
* use default and variable arguments 
* pass functions as arguments to filters
* and program simple lambdas 

3.1  Introduction 
* mastered the basics
* time to write more useful features 

3.2  Main Function 
* all Kotlin functions start with the key word ```fun``
* next is the name of the function ```helloWorld```
* followed by parenthesis for arguments ```()```
* next is the function body.  
* the body is where things happen. 
* the body is always inside curly braces. ```{}```
* Example: 
``` 
fun helloWorld() { 

}
```
*  the parenthesis can be empty if there aren't any arguments 
*  we would envoke the function by calling its name followed by the parenthesis. 


```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Let's say instead of using the interpreter we want to write a program in IntelliJ, then we would need to follow these steps: 
1.  In the left hand corner, there is a list of all of our project files and folders. 
2.  Find, then right-click, the SOURCE folder. 
3.  Select "New" "Kotlin File Class" from the pop out menus.

* Following these steps creates the file in your source folder. 
* Its extension is dot kt 
* We can use this file to write code. 
* We will still use the REPL too 
* We will switch back and forth.
