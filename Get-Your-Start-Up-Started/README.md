# Lesson 1: Set Your Goals 
* Entrepreneurs are full of contradictions. 
* Vision Statement: Declaration of Objectives.  Your "big dream" what are you focused on achieving.  
What will this business become?  Why do you exist? How will you change the world? Length? Long enough to provide a sense of purpose, call to action, describe your destination.  
* Mission Statement: Statement of your functions, market, and goals. Purpose outlines the steps needed to achieve and ground the big dream of your company.  What do you do and what steps do you intend to take to achieve it. 
* Look at examples before writing your own.  
* Bad planning - if your idea(s) are unrealistic, you won't succeed. 
* Opportunity Costs: Must be evaluated before beginning.  Evaulate, Definte, and question. New opportunities, takes longer than expected, which direction to decide to go into.  The Loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. Is there something I could be doing right now which would be a better use of my time?  How can I manage my resources better.  How can I make the best use of my skills (my team's skills)?
* Break Vision and Mission statements down into 12 months goals.  What is your core objective.  Imagine how to achieve the objective.  Set a goal.
* Don't be such a perfectionist about tiny details that you don't have ROI. 
* Optimization doesn't help if it is the first step. It is what you focus on once you've succeeded on the other goals. 
* Milestones: 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12 month goals 
* Early stage easy to get off track-loss of focus. What is the most important thing to focus on to move things forward without getting side tracked. 
* You cannot plan everything. 
* MVP = Minimum Viable Product (when it is "finished" enough; select the right set of first customers)
* Guidelines: Set up steps you will take to accomplish your goals. What will you do?  Attend events and raise awareness of your cause or product, social media marketing, what will work for you and your goals? 
* Don't follow someone else.  
* Start Ups are an industry.  Don't waste your time on the product of startups. It is an entire industry which doesn't work.
