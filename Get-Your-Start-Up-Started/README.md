# Lesson 1: Set Your Goals 
* Entrepreneurs are full of contradictions. 
* Vision Statement: Declaration of Objectives.  Your "big dream" what are you focused on achieving.  
What will this business become?  Why do you exist? How will you change the world? Length? Long enough to provide a sense of purpose, call to action, describe your destination.  
* Mission Statement: Statement of your functions, market, and goals. Purpose outlines the steps needed to achieve and ground the big dream of your company.  What do you do and what steps do you intend to take to achieve it. 
* Look at examples before writing your own.  
* Bad planning - if your idea(s) are unrealistic, you won't succeed. 
* Opportunity Costs: Must be evaluated before beginning.  Evaulate, Definte, and question. New opportunities, takes longer than expected, which direction to decide to go into.  The Loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. Is there something I could be doing right now which would be a better use of my time?  How can I manage my resources better.  How can I make the best use of my skills (my team's skills)?
* Break Vision and Mission statements down into 12 months goals.  What is your core objective.  Imagine how to achieve the objective.  Set a goal.
* Don't be such a perfectionist about tiny details that you don't have ROI. 
* Optimization doesn't help if it is the first step. It is what you focus on once you've succeeded on the other goals. 
* Milestones: 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12 month goals 
* Early stage easy to get off track-loss of focus. What is the most important thing to focus on to move things forward without getting side tracked. 
* You cannot plan everything. 
* MVP = Minimum Viable Product (when it is "finished" enough; select the right set of first customers)
* Guidelines: Set up steps you will take to accomplish your goals. What will you do?  Attend events and raise awareness of your cause or product, social media marketing, what will work for you and your goals? 
* Don't follow someone else.  
* Start Ups are an industry.  Don't waste your time on the product of startups. It is an entire industry which doesn't work. 


# Lesson 2: Define the Skills You Need 
* Actions you need to take to achieve your goals, are accomplished by skills.  
* Examine your needed skill set and fill in any skill gaps you may have. 
* Evaluate your needs in areas of Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Operations, Social Media, Legal, Accounting, Human Resources, Sales, Closing Sales, Handeling Ojections, Presenting, Prospecting, Front End development, Back end development, Mobile, Data, Copywriting, Email marketing, Automation, SEO, etc. 
* Develop the skills yourself or hire others who have proven track record in these skill sets. 
* Founders originally wear LOTs of different hats:  Product Manager, Sales Associatite, Accountant, Web developer, or something else. 
* Eventually you will employ co-founders or employees to take on more and more of your own responsibilities. You have to provide resoruces to your team.  Emotional and Physical support to your team.  Place to work, clear vision.  
* Team Building: You know you've done it right when they do something you see is amazing from the team. 
* Failure also helps find weaknessess.  Backfill. Delegate areas of failures. 
* Evaluate your needs:  Skills, Money, Time. 
* Get the right people for the job and it reduces the time it takes you to do what you are doing. 
* Can do?  Can learn?  Can hire?  Fill in the gaps with others. 
* Key hires--first 10 make or break it.  Find fans.  Enthusiastic users are the best people to bring in first. Find those who are active in the community, self selected, already passionate about you/your product/your group. 
* Types of Engineers: 1. Front End: Do you have a gap between how it works now and how you want it to work?  Design look of app, Creative interactions, Build User experiences, and make responsive interfaces. 2. Back End: Build and maintain serverse, database, while storing and distributing this data to the team. Create the infrastructure needed to keep things running smothly. 3.

Data: artitecture to collect, analyze and build pipelines to make data-based decisions. 
* Initial employees need to be jacks of all trades but have a specific skill (you don't have) but are willing to do things out side of their comfort zone and learn new skills. 
* Hire those who have: adaptability, williness, passion, & ability to learn. 
* Beg-they will sacrifice to join.  Impact you will have. 
* Sales: What problem they have and how you solve it.  Who do you sell to?  Customers, users, employees, investors. Skills: seek out new customers (prospecting), present product, handle objections, close. 
* Marketing Team:  Help everyone know who you are and what you do.  Understand who the potential client is and how to reach them.

# Lesson 3: Build Your Team 
* Options:  Cofounders, Mentors, Freelancers, First Employees to grow your team. 
* Balance between time and resources. Doing everything yourself helps you manage your resources, but it can wear you out.  
* Cofounder relationship is like a partner.  Cannot have this level of relationship with the other categories. Collaboration.  Helping one another. Companies can fail if there are friction between the cofounder's priorities. Nevertheless, one founder is a bottleneck as you can never be ill, or off. 
* Establish a set of rules about discussing difficult things--the framework for conversation. 
* Risk Profile-can all of the founders go the same length of time without returns? 
* Cofounder qualities: Complimentary skills, passion for the mission, open minded, do you get along? Emotional support?  Diversity?  Attract investors. 
* Balance between doing things quick and being well rounded 2-3 is the general magic number. 
* Trial and Error-skipped by having a Mentor. 
* Freelance (Hourly or Project-based fees) difficult to evaluate their skills and communications can be a problem.  Platforms: Elance, Freelancers, Fiverr, Upwork, other sources. 
* Issues with freelancers:  can over charge, low quality work (not what you are expecting), no communication--unresponsive. 
* Outsource - same issues, pro and con, as freelancers. 
* Hires:  How to find them. Hire bar.  Low salary to start but the potential for an amazing long-term result. Greater rewards, but more risk, in working for / with startups. 
* Hire Red Flags: Fire quickly if you took a risk and things aren't working.  To help find the best people--ask them to tell your story.  What is it that works good for you in being here?  Why? How do you see yourself contributing to our overall goal(s) and which (goals) do you see you can help with the most?  The least? 
* Spend more time with the person, to make certain they are a good fit before comitting to going forward with them. 
* Early hires set the tone.  Find those aligned and it makes a difference in the future. 
* Reach out to who you know and trust.  Who do they know and trust. Anything else is pretty toxic in the end. 
* Offer: Sense of purpose and experience. People they can learn from.

* Finance.  Important aspect. 
* Bootstrapping:  Financing your business using your own personal resources.  Benefits: Freedom, profits, committment. Downsides: Expenses, Connections, Credibility. Need to overcome negative voices.
