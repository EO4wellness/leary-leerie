<br>
## Lesson 1: Set Your Goals <br>
* Entrepreneurs are full of contradictions. <br>
* Vision Statement: Declaration of Objectives.  Your "big dream" what are you focused on achieving.  <br>
What will this business become?  Why do you exist? How will you change the world? Length? Long enough to provide a sense of purpose, call to action, describe your destination. <br> 
* Mission Statement: Statement of your functions, market, and goals. Purpose outlines the steps needed to achieve and ground the big dream of your company.  What do you do and what steps do you intend to take to achieve it. <br>
* Look at examples before writing your own.  <br>
* Bad planning - if your idea(s) are unrealistic, you won't succeed. <br>
* Opportunity Costs: Must be evaluated before beginning.  Evaulate, Definte, and question. New opportunities, takes longer than expected, which direction to decide to go into.  The Loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. Is there something I could be doing right now which would be a better use of my time?  How can I manage my resources better.  How can I make the best use of my skills (my team's skills)?<br>
* Break Vision and Mission statements down into 12 months goals.  What is your core objective.  Imagine how to achieve the objective.  Set a goal.<br>
* Don't be such a perfectionist about tiny details that you don't have ROI. <br>
* Optimization doesn't help if it is the first step. It is what you focus on once you've succeeded on the other goals. <br>
* Milestones: 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12 month goals <br>
* Early stage easy to get off track-loss of focus. What is the most important thing to focus on to move things forward without getting side tracked. <br>
* You cannot plan everything. <br>
* MVP = Minimum Viable Product (when it is "finished" enough; select the right set of first customers)<br>
* Guidelines: Set up steps you will take to accomplish your goals. What will you do?  Attend events and raise awareness of your cause or product, social media marketing, what will work for you and your goals? <br>
* Don't follow someone else.  <br>
* Start Ups are an industry.  Don't waste your time on the product of startups. It is an entire industry which doesn't work. <br>
<br>

## Lesson 2: Define the Skills You Need <br>
* Actions you need to take to achieve your goals, are accomplished by skills.  <br>
* Examine your needed skill set and fill in any skill gaps you may have. <br>
* Evaluate your needs in areas of Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Operations, Social Media, Legal, Accounting, Human Resources, Sales, Closing Sales, Handeling Ojections, Presenting, Prospecting, Front End development, Back end development, Mobile, Data, Copywriting, Email marketing, Automation, SEO, etc. <br>
* Develop the skills yourself or hire others who have proven track record in these skill sets. <br>
* Founders originally wear LOTs of different hats:  Product Manager, Sales Associatite, Accountant, Web developer, or something else. <br>
* Eventually you will employ co-founders or employees to take on more and more of your own responsibilities. You have to provide resoruces to your team.  Emotional and Physical support to your team.  Place to work, clear vision.  <br>
* Team Building: You know you've done it right when they do something you see is amazing from the team. <br>
* Failure also helps find weaknessess.  Backfill. Delegate areas of failures. <br>
* Evaluate your needs:  Skills, Money, Time. <br>
* Get the right people for the job and it reduces the time it takes you to do what you are doing. <br>
* Can do?  Can learn?  Can hire?  Fill in the gaps with others. <br>
* Key hires--first 10 make or break it.  Find fans.  Enthusiastic users are the best people to bring in first. Find those who are active in the community, self selected, already passionate about you/your product/your group. <br>
* Types of Engineers: 1. Front End: Do you have a gap between how it works now and how you want it to work?  Design look of app, Creative interactions, Build User experiences, and make responsive interfaces. 2. Back End: Build and maintain serverse, database, while storing and distributing this data to the team. Create the infrastructure needed to keep things running smothly. 3. Mobile: Create mobile experience in android or IOS apps, improve overall performance, ongoing improvements and features, test on new devices.  4. Data: artitecture to collect, analyze and build pipelines to make data-based decisions. <br>
* Initial employees need to be jacks of all trades but have a specific skill (you don't have) but are willing to do things out side of their comfort zone and learn new skills. <br>
* Hire those who have: adaptability, williness, passion, & ability to learn. <br>
* Beg-they will sacrifice to join.  Impact you will have. <br>
* Sales: What problem they have and how you solve it.  Who do you sell to?  Customers, users, employees, investors. Skills: seek out new customers (prospecting), present product, handle objections, close. <br>
* Marketing Team:  Help everyone know who you are and what you do.  Understand who the potential client is and how to reach them. <br>
* Operations Department helps you keep everyrthing running smoothly.  Lawyer, accountants, human resources. <br>
* Trust instincts. <br>
<br>

## Lesson 3: Build Your Team <br>
* Options:  Cofounders, Mentors, Freelancers, First Employees to grow your team. <br>
* Balance between time and resources. Doing everything yourself helps you manage your resources, but it can wear you out.  <br>
* Cofounder relationship is like a partner.  Cannot have this level of relationship with the other categories. Collaboration.  Helping one another. Companies can fail if there are friction between the cofounder's priorities. Nevertheless, one founder is a bottleneck as you can never be ill, or off. <br>
* Establish a set of rules about discussing difficult things--the framework for conversation. <br>
* Risk Profile-can all of the founders go the same length of time without returns? <br>
* Cofounder qualities: Complimentary skills, passion for the mission, open minded, do you get along? Emotional support?  Diversity?  Attract investors. <br>
* Balance between doing things quick and being well rounded 2-3 is the general magic number. <br>
* Trial and Error-skipped by having a Mentor. <br>
* Freelance (Hourly or Project-based fees) difficult to evaluate their skills and communications can be a problem.  Platforms: Elance, Freelancers, Fiverr, Upwork, other sources. <br>
* Issues with freelancers:  can over charge, low quality work (not what you are expecting), no communication--unresponsive. <br>
* Outsource - same issues, pro and con, as freelancers. <br>
* Hires:  How to find them. Hire bar.  Low salary to start but the potential for an amazing long-term result. Greater rewards, but more risk, in working for / with startups. <br>
* Hire Red Flags: Fire quickly if you took a risk and things aren't working.  To help find the best people--ask them to tell your story.  What is it that works good for you in being here?  Why? How do you see yourself contributing to our overall goal(s) and which (goals) do you see you can help with the most?  The least? <br>
* Spend more time with the person, to make certain they are a good fit before comitting to going forward with them. <br>
* Early hires set the tone.  Find those aligned and it makes a difference in the future. <br>
* Reach out to who you know and trust.  Who do they know and trust. Anything else is pretty toxic in the end. <br>
* Offer: Sense of purpose and experience. People they can learn from. <br>
<br>

## Lesson 4: Get capital for Your Business <br>
* Finance.  Important aspect. <br>
* Bootstrapping:  Financing your business using your own personal resources.  Benefits: Freedom, profits, committment. Downsides: Expenses, Connections, Credibility. Need to overcome negative voices. <br>
* Debt financing. Any form of loan you can use to help start your business.  You will be paying back over time--principal and interest.  Benefits: Ownership, taxes, lower interest rates for business loans.  There can be lots of options, you likely need an accountant.  Downsides: Repayment.  Unaffordable rates.  Credit rating. If things do not go according to play, this can ruin you. Do your research.  <br>
* Investors-want to give you money in exchange for future profits.  Funding, contacts, advice, motivation. Must reach out if you need to scale higher than you are able to go on your own. Downsides: Rate-of-Return, Added pressure, added communication of decsions and working through politics, giving up control, with more stressful aspects of coordinating with others and negotiating through other's key proirities and conflict resolution.  <br>
* Investor groups: 8 month road show with pitches, meetings, in order to get first investor. <br>
* Angel Investors. People who invest their own money into a new business. Usually they aren't rich but like the company.  Benefits: Investment amounts, accessiblity, ease of engagement.  Downsides: Risk adversion, want high rate of return, controlling.  <br>
* Venture Capitalists. <br> 
* Incubtors. Programs meant to help startups. Been around for a long time.  Example: Ideal Lab.  Group/organization with their own ideas.  Need teams to build their ideas.  Spin out into private companies (who you could be ejected out of).  <br>
* Accelerators.  Programs meant to help startups. Networking.  Services. Mentorship. Focus and Equity can be downside of this--they exist to help you but you can get overly focused on receiving help and not moving forward. Universities, private groups, etc. Helps companies FAIL faster. <br>
* Pick investors carefully.  It will be hard to (later) buy your investor(s) out, if you cannot work together in the future. Never take money from: a fool, family, friends. It won't work.  You're life will be miserable. <br>
* Followup:  Thank you, and then....try to connect with one main item which is unique to your dicussion with them and give them one action event (coffee shop, discussion, etc). <br>
* Responsibility comes with raising capital. Helps some, hurts others. <br>
* Accelerators are very structured.  Rest are not. <br>
* "Hear Effect" when one investor hears that others are getting involved, they want to jump on board too.  Don't wait.  Balance being proactive and nagging. <br>
* No one is born with the ability to nkow what is going to work, and even if you do have an idea that is going to be the next-greatest-one, you don't know what others are working on and may do or how it will impact you. <br>
* Honesty, transparency, openness -investor has to trust and needs relationship to work. Character.  Serious.  Being prepared. Answering Questions.<br> 
* Speed:  even the slowest chess player can beat a grand master if the slower player is given 3 turns for every one move of the grand master.  Likewise, large companies cannot move fast--they have more funding, more employees, more talents, but they cannot move fast. <br>
* Talk to at least ONE company the investor invested in previously, before entering into an arrangement of working with any investor.  <br>
* Demonstrate pitch passion, knowledge, quickly.<br>
* compromise - course correct or stay focused on the vision. <br>
* Feedback - helps to apply to big picture.  <br>
* Building relationships with investors has to be long-term, and yet find the right balance between taking feedback/input and never taking it. <br>
* Takes twice as long, and took more energy than expected--and it takes it from the building process, to achieve the capital. <br>
* Investors validate your ideas. <br> 


## Lesson 5: Create Your Pitch Deck <br>
* 10 seconds--engage the interest or lose. <br> 
* Parts to write in: 1.  Intro.  2. Details.  3. Close.  <br>
* Process: Overcome objections. Refine the pitch. <br>
* Pitch Deck-Communication tool. <br>
* Concise, Engaging, communication to express your passion and attract others to invest. <br>
* Understand: who is interested in what you are doing? <br>
* Gather your materials.  Validated Product Design.  App Monetization.  Interactive prototype. Marketing and distribution plan(s). <br>
* Practice telling your story. <br> 
*  Who should you attempt to tell your story to?  Find the right ones for your ideas. <br>
* Creating Engaging Hook. <br>
* Who are you selling too and what do they care about? Hone your pitch to them and what they care about. <br>
* Describe the problem you are solving. <br>
* Investors: Is the market big enough?  Can this solve the problem?  Is the problem realistic? Can you do it best or is someone else better poised to do so?<br>
* Solution: Describe your solution. <br>
* Details: Market size, how you are poised to do this<br>
* Networking Event-learn relevant.  Specific individuals who can help.  Identify.  <br>
* Get out Excell and do the math.  19 of 20 will fail.  Investing in 1 will not help. <br> 
* Team - Need to have multiple skills to succeed. Ability to overcome all challenges. <br>
* Team --> Market --> Return <br>
* Rejection is normal.  Why were you rejected.  Pitch not clear?  Too long? find out and improve. <br>
* Don't believe in the people.  Don't belileve it is the right time. Don't have skills.  Don't believe in the product or people. <br>
* Practice: start with those who are warm with you, let them listen and give feedback. <br>
* One Line Pitch: My company name, is devloping (a defined offering), to help (target audience solve a problem with our unique secret sauce). <br>
* 30 Seconds-try to obtain interest in 30 seconds.  Aim at 75 words. <br> 
* 60 Seconds-150 words. <br>
* feedback will help improve <br>
