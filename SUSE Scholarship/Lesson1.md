- Cloud-native: is the the set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale. 
- Cloud-native can achieve using private, hybrid, or public cloud providers. 
-- needs to be agile

[1.5 CNCF and Cloud-Native Tooling](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd064-1/parts/30cb07da-8fd4-4438-a209-b3457adb5d82/modules/7b21dfa4-aac8-4d24-82c5-65325e6dc691/lessons/092ac437-081d-4946-b54d-a2f537931c13/concepts/79ae4fb8-2601-43f5-a879-8470d4a6c21c)
* Tools to manage containers at scale
* Container Orchestrators
  - Docker Swarm 
  - Apache Mesos 
  - Kubernetes 
* Kubernetes took the lead to define. 
* Kubernetes started in 2015 from Borg, a google-open source container orchestrator.
* Kubernetes is now a part of CNCF
* CNCF is Cloud Native Computing Foundation 
* CNCF was founded in 2015
* vendor neutral home to open-source projects 
  - Kubernetes

2021-06-13 Today we are to conclude our week one of studies in the course and the course milestone suggestions include we should be done with lesson one by the end of today.  I posted in the student slack seeking to help anyone who hasn't finished.  I'm currently in lesson 3, so I'm good as far as meeting the suggested deadlines.
