## [1.4 Introduction to Cloud-Native ](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd064-1/parts/30cb07da-8fd4-4438-a209-b3457adb5d82/modules/7b21dfa4-aac8-4d24-82c5-65325e6dc691/lessons/092ac437-081d-4946-b54d-a2f537931c13/concepts/6197dd89-0c18-4bb1-998d-e7baa69aef65) 
- Cloud-native: is the the set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale. 
- Cloud-native can achieve using private, hybrid, or public cloud providers. 
-- needs to be agile 
-- needs speed
-- integrating customer feedback
-- adapting to technology
* Cloud Native Tooling 
* Cloud Native Applications 
* "Cloud native refers to the set of practices which empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale, 
 while using private, hybrid, or public cloud providers." 
* the key to cloud native deployment is SPEED and AGILITY 
* this means how quickly an organiation can respond to change
* while increasing its feature velocity 
* containers are closely-associated with Cloud Native terminology 
* containers are SMALL and MANAGEABLE units 
* containers have an application running inside 
* container pros: 
  - can be deployed FAST
  - is RESILIENT 
  - is Easily Managed 
* microservice architecture is often chosen 
* miscroservices represents 
  - small services 
  - independent services 
  - can be easily containerized 

## [1.5 CNCF and Cloud-Native Tooling](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd064-1/parts/30cb07da-8fd4-4438-a209-b3457adb5d82/modules/7b21dfa4-aac8-4d24-82c5-65325e6dc691/lessons/092ac437-081d-4946-b54d-a2f537931c13/concepts/79ae4fb8-2601-43f5-a879-8470d4a6c21c)
* Tools to manage containers at scale
* Container Orchestrators
  - Docker Swarm 
  - Apache Mesos 
  - Kubernetes 
* Kubernetes took the lead to define. 
* Kubernetes started in 2015 from Borg, a google-open source container orchestrator.
* Kubernetes is now a part of CNCF
* CNCF is Cloud Native Computing Foundation 
* CNCF was founded in 2015
* vendor neutral home to open-source projects 
  - Kubernetes
  - Prometheus 
  - ETCD
  - Envoy
  - more 
* Kubernetes is a container orchestrator that is capable of solutionize the integration of the following functionalities:
  - runtime
  - netowkring
  - storage 
  - service mesh
  - logs and metrics
  - tracking 
* need a tool to manage containers at scale 
* overtime multiple tool appeared 
* Examples: Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes 
* Kubernetes took the lead. 
* Kubernetes sucecss: 
  - how containerized workloads should be deployed
  - managed
  - configured 
* Kubernetes grew out of Borg 
* Borg was a google open-source software that orchestrated containers 
* Kubernetes was released in 2014. 
* Kubernetes is now maintained by CNCF
* Cloud Native computing Foundation (CNCF)
* Kubernetes is a container orchestrator. 
* Kubernetes automates configuration, management, and scalability of an application. 
* Following, Kubernetest capabilities were extended. 
* Now Kubernetes inegrates wtih other tools 
* Now includes: 
  - runtime for application execution environment 
  - network for application connectivity 
  - storage for application resources 
  - service mesh for granular control of traffic within a cluster 
  - logs and metrics to construct the obervability stack 
  - tracing for building the full request journey 
  - many more 
* most of these tools are maintained under the CNCF umbrella 
* CNCF was founded in 2015
* CNCF provides vendor-neutrol home to open source projects 
 - Kubernetes 
 - Prometheus 
 - ETCD 
 - Envoy 
 - many more (more than 1,300 associated projects)

2021-06-13 Today we are to conclude our week one of studies in the course and the course milestone suggestions include we should be done with lesson one by the end of today.  I posted in the student slack seeking to help anyone who hasn't finished.  I'm currently in lesson 3, so I'm good as far as meeting the suggested deadlines.
