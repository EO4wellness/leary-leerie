/*

Concatenation of Strings

it isn't math 

it adds together exact what is in each string

add space(s) and punctuation as needed 

Example:

"Hello" + "World" 

Returns 
HelloWorld

Example 2: 
"Hello, " + "There World!" 

Returns 
Hello, There World!

these are all examples of string concatenation in JavaScript
