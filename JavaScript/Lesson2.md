* In this lesson, we learn to represent real-world data using JavaScript variables, and distinguesh between the different data types in the language.

# Course Notes:

2.1 Intro to Data Types 
* Data is everywhere. 
* Data helps us understand the world, make future decisions, help us organize information.  
* Data in coding is important too. 
* Information being gathered. 
* What are types in JavaScript. 

2.2 Numbers 
* Defining numbers (a data type) in JavaScript is fairly simple. 
* The NUMBER data type includes any positive or negative integer. 
* Decimals are also within the NUMBER data type. 
* Entering a number into the JavaScript console will return it back again to you.  
* Arithmetic Operations: type out any expression in the way you would type in a calculator. 
* Example within the JavaScript Console

            3 + 2.1 
            
            Returns:
            5.1

            QUIZ: 
            
            1. Enter the expressions (one at a time) into the console and determine what each expression evalutes to: 
            
            2 + 10 - 19 + 4 - 90 + 1  --> returns  -92
            
            -20 + -19 - (-10) - (-1) + 24 --> returns -4 
            
            (10/5) * 4 -20 --> returns -12
            
            4096 % 12 --> returns 4
            
* Comparing Numbers - you can compare two numbers to see if one's greaer than, less than, or equal to the other. 

            5 > 10 --> returns false 
            
            5 < 10 --> returns true 
            
            5 == 10 --> returns false 
            
* Comparisons between numbers will always return either "true" or "false" they don't return any other types of answers. 
*  Operator and its Meaning Chart 

                  <   Less than 
                  >   Greater than 
                  <=  Greater than or Equal to 
                  >=  Greater than or Equal to 
                  ==  Equal to 
                  !=  Not Equal to 
                  
                  
                  QUIZ: 
                  Enter each express below, one at a time, into the JavaScript Console and determine what each expression evaluates to.
                  
                  43 > 47 --> False 
                  
                  12==17 --> False 
                  
                  3 <=3 --> True
                  
                  1!=0 --> True 
                  
* TIP: The values true and false have significant importance in JavaScript. These values are called Booleans and are another data type in JavaScript. Later in this lesson, youâ€™ll learn more about why Booleans are so important in programming.
