# Lesson 7: Objects 
* Meet the next JavaScript data structure: the object. 
* Learn to use it to store complex data alongside arrays. 

7.1 Intro to Objects 
* OBJECTS are an incredibly powerful feature of JavaScript
* Objects allow us to in a sense "wrap up" pieces of related information & processes into one container. 
* ARRAYS are a special kind of objects. 
* ARRAYS have properties like: LENGTH 
* ARRAYS have methods like: REVERSE, SORT, PUSH, and POP. 
* arrays are therefore useful when working with structured data. 
* Objects are not just limited to arrays. 
* JavaScript comes with an entire other set of built-in objects.
* You can create your own objects.
