**Hello World!**<br>
This repo was made to follow along with these basic courses outlined below.<br>

# Writing READMEs Course:
Every thing has its very beginning.  And this is my very beginning on Github, learning to use Git, and various courses. I began this account in order to follow some older courses I didn't follow through with much until recently.  My GitHub account was thusly created in 2019, but I only recently started using it more often (end of 2020 and onward). Because there was so much of a gap inbetween my early learning days, and now, I still used this original repo I created using Git Commands, but I restudied the lessons involved in its original creation.  The order I studied is presented here, beginning with the very first course on what a README file is, how you use it, what it looks like, where it goes, and the best practices to follow in creating one (or dozens). Read more about my learning "readme" journey in it's [README course folder](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/tree/master/course-on-writing-readme-files)

# Known Issues 
1.  Need to finish write-up on Version Control Course as time affords me to do so. <br>
2.  The Version Control course recommends consulting the [SHELL WORKSHOP](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud206) course.  This should be written up here too, for sake of complete record of the studies I've undertaken, as I completed this workshop coursework several years ago. <br>
3. Clean up file structure/organization to make it easier to follow. 
4. Add folder structures. Clean up links. 

[x]~~Need to fix the [SYNTAX section](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/blob/master/READme-course-notes.md) now that I know how to write CODE blocks distinct from regular markdown ~~
[ ] Need to learn about Git Ignore files. saw a link to that in the Git book, as well as it is a repo of usefult templates to cut-n-paste the git ignore fileshttps://github.com/github/gitignore for furture study/reference
