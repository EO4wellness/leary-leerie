**Hello World!**<br>
This repo was made to follow along with these basic courses outlined below. 
The original course I took with Udacity about creating a GIT account included to name the initial repo something funny, quirky or a pun.

# Writing READMEs Course:
2020-12-08: Every thing has its very beginning.  And this is my very beginning on Github, learning to use Git, and various courses. I began this account in order to follow some older courses I didn't follow through with much until recently.  My GitHub account was thusly created in 2019, but I only recently started using it more often (end of 2020 and onward). Because there was so much of a gap inbetween my early learning days, and now, I still used this original repo I created using Git Commands, but I restudied the lessons involved in its original creation.  The order I studied is presented here, beginning with the very first course on what a README file is, how you use it, what it looks like, where it goes, and the best practices to follow in creating one (or dozens). Read more about my learning "readme" journey in it's [README course folder](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/tree/master/course-on-writing-readme-files)

# Version Control Course: 
After learning about how to write a proper README.MD file, the next recommended course within Udacity is the [Version Control Course](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/blob/master/version-control/readme.md).  I began studying the version Control course in December, 2020, and took a break to study more about the additional recommended courses such as the shell Workship, see note below, and Linux workshop, see below, and will continue to study the version control course through to completion too. 

# Shell Workshop
Installing, working with Git Bash, and command line interface terminal to the shell.

# Known Issues 
* The Version Control course recommends consulting the [SHELL WORKSHOP](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud206) course.  This should be written up here too, for sake of complete record of the studies I've undertaken, as I completed this workshop coursework several years ago. <br>

### RESOLVED 
~~Need to fix the [SYNTAX section](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/blob/master/READme-course-notes.md) now that I know how to write CODE blocks distinct from regular markdown ~~
~~Need to learn about Git Ignore files. saw a link to that in the Git book, as well as it is a repo of usefult templates to cut-n-paste the git ignore files https://github.com/github/gitignore for furture study/reference 
[x] 1.  Need to finish write-up on Version Control Course as time affords me to do so. <br>
[x] 3. Clean up file structure/organization to make it easier to follow. and 4. Add folder structures. Clean up links.   (realized, doing this changes links and other things--so this is something i need to pre-plan into my file structure.  my thoughts on this are evolving and developing but basically i see a need for a FOLDER --> with README.md (with navigation links to other resources and references) with a folder for IMAGES  RESOURCES CODE and perhaps other items as needed per project.  However, when I first started this Git repo, I hadn't realize that yet. ~~
