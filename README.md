# Known Issues 
1.  Need to finish write-up on Version Control Course as time affords me to do so. <br>
2.  The Version Control course recommends consulting the [SHELL WORKSHOP](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud206) course.  This should be written up here too, for sake of complete record of the studies I've undertaken, as I completed this workshop coursework several years ago. <br>

[x]~~Need to fix the [SYNTAX section](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/blob/master/READme-course-notes.md) now that I know how to write CODE blocks distinct from regular markdown ~~
