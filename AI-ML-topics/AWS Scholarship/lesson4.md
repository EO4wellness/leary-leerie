# Lesson 4 Notes
* When I arrived to this course, Lesson 4 was nearly completed already.
* This is because I did this portion of the coursework last year. 
* However, there were new exercises. 
* HURRAY!  üçæ
* I did these exercises today (2021-06-27)

# Tech Issue: 
* When first running the Jupyter Notebook I received an error. 
* I found the solution writen up at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57776015/error-while-reading-csv-file-unicode-error-unicodeescape-codec-cant-decode 
* When I entered the "r" (lower case) for "raw" before my file location, then the notebook ran and functioned properly.
