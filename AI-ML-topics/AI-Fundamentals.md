4. Stakeholders
Summary
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are team sport. The number of roles involved in AI and ML initiatives can vary based on the organizations' size. Most organizations start with a Machine Learning team and complement with an AI team moving forward.

Key stakeholders you may need to colaborate with: 
   - External Stakeholders: Executives, customers, and managers from other groups in the organization.
   - Data Scientists: They identify use cases and determine the suitable datasets and algorithms for experiments. They build the AI models.
   - Data Engineers: They focus on making the data available and accessible to data scientists integrating various data sources, optimizing access to data.
   - AI Architects: They connect data scientists, data engineers, software developers, and developer operations to get the solution up and running, including the assessment of infrastructure requirements.
   - ML Engineers: Subject matter experts in their area and make sure AI models are suitable for production use.
   - AI Developer: Focuses on the development and implementation of AI solutions.
   - Data Analyst: Uses machine learning to extract insights from data.

5. History of AI and ML
Summary
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning adoption is increasing every day. The principles behind AI and ML, such as Mathematics, Economics, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Linguistics, and Computer Engineering, all have their fair share in today's AI and ML history.

   - 1943: McCulloch and Pitts created a model of a neuron. The thinking was that the ability to model a neuron would help create an artificial human brain and intelligence.
   - 1950: The first Turing test was announced. A machine hidden behind a curtain was tested by a human on the side of the curtain. If the tester could not identify the identity as a machine, it would have been a success for AI. No one passed a full Turing test so far, but just limited versions.
   - 1956: The first Artificial Intelligence conference in Dartmouth happened.
   - The 1960s: The first robot Shakey that incorporated robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing, was able to move boxes in a room.
   - The 1970s: Lack of computing resources resulted in a decrease in interest in AI. This period in AI History is now called AI Winter.
   - The 1980s-90s: The first autonomous trip from New York to LA was the "No Hands Across America". DeepBlue for Chess brought a lot of interest in AI.
   - The 2010s: AI defeated the human world champion at GO.

Quiz: 
Considering AI's history, which one is a slow down in progress and a reduction of interest in AI and ML?
Correct! AI winter defines the area where interest in AI decreased.

New Terms
    Autonomous: An autonomous system is a system that can accomplish a task without human involvement during the execution of the task.
    Go: An abstract strategy-based board game.
    Turing Test: A test where a human tested interacts with two entities, one machine, and one human, without knowing which one is which. The goal of the test is to assess if the tester can identify which one is the machine. If the tester can not determine the machine or is not sure, the machine passes the test.

7. When to use and not to use AI
Summary
When not to use AI and ML?

    The lack of good, high-quality data would be an issue to get high confidence results. In this case, we suggest getting the data first.
    Do not use AI and ML if you are looking to get 100% correct answers at all times. Predictions and pattern recognition methods will not get you what you want. You have to be ok with wrong answers with varying confidence levels.
    The world is changing. Make sure your data and predictions help you within the confines of the nonstationary world. You can’t use data from last year to predict healthcare or finance situations post COVID.

When to use AI and ML?

    If finding patterns is your primary goal, you are on the right path. Make sure your patterns are generalizable. You might be able to find a pattern of rainy days for the last year. But if that does not provide a good prediction for tomorrow, who cares about that pattern?
    You have to be ok with approximate solutions instead of exact solutions.

Quiz Question
In which scenario AI and ML might not be a good fit?
- Extracting sentiment from human speech 
- Predicting when someone can get cancer (Correct. Predicting when someone will get cancer suggests that they will get cancer. This goes into the area of looking for a 100% correct answer and will not be a good fit for AI and ML.)
- Predicting how long a player will play a game 
- predicting what books a book reader would like reading.
