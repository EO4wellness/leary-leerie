Taken a number of courses with Udacity about machine learning, artificial intelligence and more. This repo is a chronical of my course/learning history.

As well as my [Coursework and Notes](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/blob/master/AI-ML-topics/AI-Fundamentals.md)  and [course glossary](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/blob/master/AI-ML-topics/glossary.md).  Additionally, I created a public flashcard set anyone can use to study the terms in this course or to brush up on the fundamentals.  You can find [this course's flashcard set here](https://www.brainscape.com/packs/udacity-ai-fundamentals-17974857).
