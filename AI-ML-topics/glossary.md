* Anomaly Detection: Detecting data points that do not align with a recognized pattern across a set of data points.
* API: Application programming interfaces that are exposed to help multiple applications and systems interact with each other.
* Autonomous: An autonomous system is a system that can accomplish a task without human involvement during the execution of the task.
* Azure Cognitive Services: A suite of AI Services targeting specialized AI workloads to help developers implement AI capabilities into their solution with minimal AI and ML expertise.
* Azure Machine Learning: A cloud-based service that delivers a platform supporting the creation and deployment of Machine Learning Models.
* Computer Vision: A domain of artificial intelligence focused on processing and understanding visual inputs through complex machine learning algorithms.
* Dataset: A dataset is a collection of data that is used to train the machine during the AI and ML processes.
* Experiment: In the context of AI and ML, experiment refers to using the AI and ML processes to see if a particular question can be answered with AI and ML, or a hypothesis can be supported or validated.
* Go: An abstract strategy-based board game.
* Intent: An intent represents the action the user wants to execute. It usually refers to a preferred action when a user delivers a sentence to be interpreted by the machine.
* Jupyter Notebook: A virtual notebook environment where developers can write notes and combine live code and visualizations into a single document.
* Machine Learning Model: A machine learning model is a logic that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns.
* Machine Learning Operations (MLOps): The practice involves the automation of processes required to build and deliver end-to-end Machine Learning Models and experiences.
* Natural Language Processing: A domain of artificial intelligence focused on understanding human language and helping computers and humans interact through human language.
* Turing Test: A test where a human tested interacts with two entities, one machine, and one human, without knowing which one is which. The goal of the test is to assess if the tester can identify which one is the machine. If the tester can not determine the machine or is not sure, the machine passes the test.
