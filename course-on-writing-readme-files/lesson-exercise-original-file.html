<h1>My Fabulous Recipe</h1>

<p>This recipe for <strong>cereal and milk</strong> has been passed down my family for months.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Cereal (you can find cool cereals <a href="www.example.com/coolcereals">here</a>)</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>If I were writing these out as <em>code</em>, it might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if bowl is empty:
    add cereal
if bowl only has cereal in it:
    add milk
</code></pre>
</body>
