# Version Control Course
Review of terms and concepts learned in lesson #1: Installing Git.<br>
<br>
## Lesson 2
Now that Git is installed, configured, and ready to work with we will be learning 3 things you can do with your newly installed Git comand line prompt. <br>
1.  Repo.  Repo is short for repository.  You cannot work with Git if you don't have a repo (repository) to work with.  "Repo" is short for Repository and therefore they can be used interchangably.
2.  Clone. <br>
3.  Satus. <br>

## Commands Used in this lesson 
* git init<br>
* git clone <br>
* git status <br>

## Git Init 
* Is a command to create brand-new repositories on your computer. <br>
* Before you can make a committ or do anytihng else, you need to have a place to work.  That place is called a repo, or repository.<br>
* The "init" part of this command stands for initialize.  
        
        ls - used to list files and directories
        mkdir - used to create a new directory
        cd - used to change directories
        rm - used to remove files and directories
        pwd - used to print working directory and rediscover where you are at if you get lost as to which directory you are in, currently. 
        
* It is recommended to make a specific repo for this course work and use the GIT commands to do so.

        create a directory called udacity-git-course
        inside that, create another directory called new-git-project
        use the cd command to move into the new-git-project directory

## Git Clone 
Is a command which will exactly copy files from somewhere else to your computer. <br>

## Git Status 
Is a command you can use to check the status of a repo and during this lesson we learn the importance of knowing the status, as well as the importance of checking the status.
