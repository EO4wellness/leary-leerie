A certain length or format for what needs to be in a README. Communicate clearly what any end-user of your code/project would need to use the code.  Do not make any assumptions about what the user of your code may already know.

1.  What are the exact steps which need to be taken?
2. What should someone who is going to use this repository already have installed or configured before beginning with this code? 
3.  What might a user of this repository have a hard time understanding right away?
