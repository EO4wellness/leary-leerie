# Overview
* Intro to Python is a [free Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)
* This course is listed as a prerequisite for both [AWS ML](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/tree/master/AI-ML-topics/AWS%20Scholarship) and [SUSE Cloud Native](https://github.com/EO4wellness/leary-leerie/tree/master/SUSE%20Scholarship) Scholars. 

# My Course Notes:
* upon visiting this course for the SUSE scholarship, I discovered the first two lessons were already completed previously. 
* I am reviewing those two lessons, sumarized below, and then completing the coursework. 
* In order to finish the AWS ML Fundamentals AND these prerequisites in time, I plan to work on completion of
  this Intro to Python course in the first 4 weeks of the AWS ML phase 1 scholarship 

## L1:
[History of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python)

Python is case sensitive. 
Spacing matters.
Mistakes help you to learn.

## L2: Integers and Operators 
Data Types: Integers, Floats, Booleans, Strings
Operators: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical
Built-In Functions, Type Conversion
Whitespace and Style Guidelines

### Output
```print()```
Built in function which prints out what ever you put 
inside the parenthesis 

### Arithmetic operators
```
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Mod (the remainder after dividing)
** Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, 
    as you might have seen in other languages)
// Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer
```
### Order of Operations 
is the same as that of normal mathematics: 
- parentheses first, 
- then exponentiation, 
- then multiplication/division, 
- and then addition/Subtraction

Here, the Udacity Into to Python course had a link to an outdated resource.  
After reporting this to the Udacity team,  I googled other resources to review order in maths. 
This [website appears to have a PDF copy](http://lms.southeasterntech.edu/GENED/MAT/DDAVIS/MATH%201111%20Logarithm%20Order%20of%20Operations.pdf) of the original website the course materials originally linked to. 
Also, [Khan Academy Order of Operations: Practice](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/cc-6th-arithmetic-operations/cc-6th-order-of-operations/v/introduction-to-order-of-operations) is a good refresher for those who need it. 

It's time to try a calculation in Python!
My electricity bills for the last three months 
have been $23, $32 and $64. What is the average 
monthly electricity bill over the three month period? 
Write an expression to calculate the mean, and use
```print()```  to show the result.

My Answer:

```
print((23+32+64)/3)
```

Tip: Don't confuse [Bitwise Operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) with math Operators
