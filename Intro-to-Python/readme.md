Course Notes:

# L1:
[History of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python)

Python is case sensitive. 
Spacing matters.
Mistakes help you to learn.

# L2: Integers and Operators 
Data Types: Integers, Floats, Booleans, Strings
Operators: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical
Built-In Functions, Type Conversion
Whitespace and Style Guidelines

## Output
```print()```
Built in function which prints out what ever you put 
inside the parenthesis 

## Arithmetic operators
```
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Mod (the remainder after dividing)
** Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, 
    as you might have seen in other languages)
// Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer
```
## Order of Operations 
is the same as that of normal mathematics: 
- parentheses first, 
- then exponentiation, 
- then multiplication/division, 
- and then addition/subtraction.
