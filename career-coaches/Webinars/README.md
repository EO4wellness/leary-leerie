- Begin by knowing your industry.  It is okay to be new.  What do they want?  How can you go about getting those skills and/or highlight them if you already have them.
- Create content on LinkedIn and GitHub; This gets you known. 
- Balance "teach" and "brag" so that you are showing what you know, displaying it, as well as sharing your success stories. 
- Solid confidence in your skill set. 
- Find or Narrow your focus. It doesn't need to be "figure out what you will do for the rest of your life" and instead focus on what's the next, best, step to take. 
- Some beginners believe in the "If I know a bit of everything, tech wise, I'll be more flexible" approach aren't going to be able to to network, or be as noticed by employers, as those who have 8-10 AI projects in the Health Care industry, for example. 
- Networking wise-focus on reaching out to others who are in the position you're seeking (entry level, etc.)
